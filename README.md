# Gif-Finder-Web-App
This is a web application that allows users to not only click on a button to see the top 15 gifs from the title of the button that was pressed, but also allows for users to use the search option to search for a gif subject. When the submit button is pressed, the page will then add a button to the screen that, when clicked, will append the top 15 gifs to the page from the subject of that gif. This web application is powered by the Giphy API along with jQuery, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
